# yeo_parcellations
These are the wholebrain Yeo Parcellations (with &lt;5 voxels removed), as well as Default Network subsystems we use frequently.

File Directory:
Wholebrain parcellation: dmn_yeo.zip 
Wholebrain parcellation labels: yeo_dmn_labels.csv
Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) subsystem NIFTI file: mtl_subsystem.nii.gz
Core DN subsystem NIFTI file: dmn_core_subsystem.nii.gz
DMPFC subsytem NIFTI file: dmpfc_subsytem_roi.nii.gz

Cluster Counts. Note that there are more parcel counts in these than NIFTI files because I removed parcels that were less than 5 voxels!
