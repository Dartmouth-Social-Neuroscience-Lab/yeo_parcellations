# Yeo Parcellations 
These are the wholebrain Yeo Parcellations (with parcels with 5 or less voxels removed), as well as Default Network subsystems we use frequently.

<br> **File Directory**:
<br> Wholebrain parcellation: dmn_yeo.zip 
<br> Wholebrain parcellation labels: yeo_dmn_labels.csv
<br> Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) subsystem NIFTI file: mtl_subsystem.nii.gz
<br> Core DN subsystem NIFTI file: dmn_core_subsystem.nii.gz
<br> DMPFC subsytem NIFTI file: dmpfc_subsytem_roi.nii.gz

**Cluster Count**
<br> *Note that there are more parcel counts in these than NIFTI files because I removed parcels that were less than 5 voxels!*
